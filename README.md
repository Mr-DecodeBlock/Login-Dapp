# Simple Web3 Login Dapp

This is my first project messing with web3 shenanigans.
</br></br>
Also my first project with chakra-ui and typescript and I have to say I like it!
It was fun messing around with customization and colors of the lib! 

In this dapp you can login with your MetaMask wallet and see your adress and ETH balance, changing wallets is supported too!

run the command with

```
yarn start
```

and

```
yarn build
```
